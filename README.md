# Complex-Numbers
A program to calulate complex numbers
Since a complex number is in the form of a+bi, its easy to create a program that can calculate whole numbers.
But the question is how do we deal with i (imaginary number)?
Using String tokenizer, we can succsefully calculate a complex numbers.
This program is a good exercise that deals with String tokenizer.

A practical use for calculating complex numbers:
1) Could be nice to use on your math homework.
2) If dealing speech recognition, sound waves are in the form of sine
   and you need complex numbers to succesfully handle speech recognition systems.
